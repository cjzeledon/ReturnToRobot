# Return To Robot Daily Project

In week 1 of Back-End Fundamentals, you built a directory site with job and skill information for robots.

Today, you should download the same data you used in that project. The download link is included here.

data.js (23 KB) // this file is not downloadable

Load this data into MongoDB and rebuild the directory site. You will have to query the database via the MongoDB library (mongodb) to get this data.

This time, add links at the top of the page to go to a page of robots that are currently looking for work and a page of robots that are currently employed.
